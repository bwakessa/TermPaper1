## Task Formulation & Approach

The City of Toronto is avid on regulating and enforcing traffic laws, especially speeding laws. The city first introduced the Automated Speed Enforcement (ASE) system in 2019, and saw the first 50 ASE cameras being installed in July of 2020.

Drivers who are caught speeding by a camera are tagged by their carplates, and are charged at different rates depending on their speed. As per the Ontario Court of Justice (@OntarioCourts2024), the charges are as follows:

Table 1: Speeding Charges by Rate

|                              |               |
|------------------------------|---------------|
| 1-19 km/h above speed limit  | \$5.00/km     |
| 20-29 km/h above speed limit | \$7.50/km     |
| 30-49 km/h above speed limit | \$12.00/km    |
| 50+ km/h above speed limit   | Court Settled |

In this paper, we will investigate the efficacy of the ASE system in Toronto in 2023. We will take a look at how many charges were laid by ASE cameras per month, and compute interesting statistics and values like potential revenue.

## Data

The data was gathered from Open Data Toronto (citeOpenDataToronto)

The dataset we're interested in is very simple. The only feature it needs to contain is the number of ASE charges. We can delimit this feature in many ways, but we will do it by months. For example, the final cleaned & transformed dataset could look something like this:

| Month         | Number of Charges |
|---------------|-------------------|
| January 2023  | 974               |
| February 2023 | 1294              |
| March 2023    | 1106              |
| ...           | ...               |

The exact shape of the dataset can vary, but it must somehow communicate the total number of ASE charges per month in the city of Toronto. We could then graph something like this:
